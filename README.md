## What you’ll learn
* How to design and construct an app using the “app shell” method
* How to make your app work offline
* How to store data for use offline later

## What you’ll need
* Chrome 52 or above, though any browser that supports service workers and `cache.addAll()` will work
* [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or use your own web server of choice.
* The [sample code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/your-first-pwapp/archive/master.zip)
* A text editor
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* (Optional) Node is required in the last step to deploy to Firebase


1) Web Server for Chrome -- use "200 OK"
2) point to start-up folder "work"
3) work on these files: 
	work\index.htm			>> start here
	work\service-worker.js	>> service worker JS for index
	work\manifest.json		>> for mobile-web; save as homepage icon
	scripts\app.js			>> the logic
4) run index.html
